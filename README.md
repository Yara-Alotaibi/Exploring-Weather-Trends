# Exploring-Weather-Trends
This is my Udacity first project !!
The project analyzes the local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. The tool used is Excel.

This repository contains two files. One is a pdf file, which is the documentation of the project. The other is the data that I extracted from the database and stored it in a CSV file.
